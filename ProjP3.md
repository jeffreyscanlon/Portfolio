### My audience
My story is designed for the general public and for people who identify with any point along the U.S. political spectrum. More specifically, however, I hope to reach individuals who identify strongly with either the Democratic or Republican parties, as these individuals tend to be the most polarized and are most likely to demonstrate divisive actions or rhetoric. I have made several intentional decisions when designing my data story for this audience. I will note those decisions below in the order they appear within my story.
1. First, I tried to set up my "cover page" to be as inclusive as possible. I used the title "Common Ground" so as to let the reader know that this is not a story that points the finger and casts blame onto one group or another. I also used the subtitle "How *anyone* can build bridges..." to reinforce the notion that this post is intended for people of all backgrounds. I also decided to create an animation that shows two balls (red and blue) that begin overlapping, but then suddenly drift apart. However, I added the icon of a person who is "observing" this happen from a distance and then becomes fully alerted to this issue at the end of the sequence. I felt that something like this might help the reader take a step back, separate themselves from their own party affiliation, and be open to listening to my story like the icon in the animation: an external observer who has the power to do something.
2. Throughout my story, I try to represent various perspectives, political viewpoints, and identities roughly equally, and I refrain from making normative statements or judgements about the ideals that underline these viewpoints. Rather, I focus my criticisms on only the shared problem at hand: polarization. Ways that I try to introduce balance and multiple perspectives include the video from the vice presidential debate (in which both Mike Pence and Kamala Harris are featured), in the image of a Black woman at a protest followed by an image of police officers at a protest, in the photographs of my "Action" section, which capture individuals of different identity groups coming together, and in some of the calls-to-action themselves, which feature a video of conversation highlights from participants of various backgrounds and stories featuring a Black American woman and a Georgia farmer.
3. In my critiques, I analyze the problem as being one that is shared by both parties. Therefore, I do not disaggregate the data into Republican vs. Democrat, and in fact I highlight multiple times that fact that much of this data is very similar across the two groups.
4. I also tried to use photos to reflect ideals that many Americans agree on, as a means of generating buy-in to the idea that if we can agree on these ideals, then we have already established common ground. For example, I use the reveal effect in Shorthand to show an old and cracked image of flag painted on wood transforming into a vibrant, restored version of this flag. I believe it communicates that idea that no one wants America to be this divided, and expresses the hope that people feel that things will improve. Likewise for the image that read "Fight Today for a Better Tomorrow," which doesn't explicitly pose a political belief but rather communicates a hopefulness that many seek to have.

### Additional Design Decisions
While I've already noted several of the design decisions I made while completing this project, there are a few more that are worth mentioning. Unfortunately, I was not able to master the art (and code) of the customizable HTML formatting on Shorthand, so I had to resort to choosing one of the two themes that are provided. These themes provided somewhat limited options as to the different design features you can incorporate, so I had to work within the constaints given. For example, one thing I had to work around was the fact that I could not find a way to embed a visualization (such as an iframe from Flourish or Infogram) into the anchored portion of a scrollmation feature. I was only able to embed these features onto the portions that scrolled, which was not ideal in my mind because I would have wanted to keep the visualization in place and to scroll through the relevant analysis for that visualization. For that reason, I ended up using imaages for many of my visualizations and posting those images to the anchored portion (the background) of a scrollmation. This is seen in the first portion of the "A Divided Nation" section and in the "Remedies" section.

Another challenge I had with the formatting was consistent use of fonts. This is because I was integrating data from multiple sources (Shorthand, Flourish, Canva, and Excel) and many of the fonts offered from these platforms are not supported under basic Shorthand themes. Though not perfect, I did try to reduce the noticeable difference in fonts. I used Roboto in Flourish and Canva to match the font from Shorthand, though there may be certain inconsistencies depending on if "narrow" or "condensed" font types were available. Roboto is not supported in my Microsoft Office programs, so I used Arial in graphs produced in Excel as I was approximating that these fonts are roughly similar.

I also tried to use consisent background color for all of my visualizations: black, with accompanying font in white (for titles and other important text features) and gray (for gridlines, tick marks, and less important labels). I felt that this style allowed for certain colors to really pop, but moreover, I decided to use this as an attempt to unify my visualizations because I knew I would be using a variety of colors (blues, reds, and in some cases greens). Color schemes were difficult to settle on (particularly red/blue dichotomy) because I didn't want to send a message about Republicans vs. Democrats, Hot vs. Cold, or Good vs. Bad that I was not trying to communicate.

Overall, I am pretty happy with this data story. If I had another week or two, there are certainly things that I would spend a little more time tweaking and adjusting, and there are potentially other data sources I would like to add. For example, Pew has a really great visualization that shows how the distributions of the Democratic and Republican parties have shifted away from each other since 1994. However, I was not able to find the actual data necessary for me to redesign this visualization and make it suitable for my story. However, I think with a little more digging, I might be able to find this data.

I hope you enjoy my data story. Please take a look for yourself:\
