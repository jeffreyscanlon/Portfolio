## User Research Protocol -- Interview Notes:

#### Interview with J.S. on 10/3/2020:
1.	What do you think is the overall purpose of this story?
It is showing the divide about the divide. People are experiencing political isolation. The first remedy is talking about experiences with people that are from a different group than you (so Democrat/Republican). The second graph is talking about the ability of perspective-taking that allows someone to tolerate/work with someone who is different from them. The third remedy is looking at the average bias (comparing the control and …) and how this one thing can help mitigate. Oh, these are remedies. Cool. That makes more sense. You are presenting issues and then these are the three solutions.

2.	Which visualization(s) or part of the story made the most sense or was the most convincing?
Easiest to understand: Our Aspirations vs. Our Reality and 8 out of 10 because very straight-forward.


3.	Which visualizations(s) or part of the story made the least sense or was the least convincing?
Hardest to understand: Remedy #2 Perspective-taking but mostly because I don't know what perspective-taking is. I get it's an intervention and I'm also guessing you will explain it so with explanation I think I would get it faster.

4.	Can you explain how the solutions presented in this story are connected to the problem?
Remedy 1 is talking about tolerance for individuals and positive intergroup contact…People from different backgrounds or different beliefs, there is poor contact with them. So intergroup contact increases contact. Perspective-taking allows for common ground and compromise and helps you feel less cold toward others. Democrat/Republic

5.	What other questions or recommendations do you have?
I think if you are trying to connect to people that don’t know statistics or science the terms (baseline or control might not make sense) or other terms like positive intergroup contact, but I don’t know how you would do that with graphics.

#### Interview with M.C. on 10/6/2020:

#### Supplemental feedback -- I also met with the course TA on 10/6/2020 and she provided helpful feedback I'd like to record here:
- She thinks the changes made to Visualization for Finding #1 were a success -- said that in her opinion it was very clear to understand now.
- She provided some ideas for Finding #3 -- said that the graphs stacked vertically might do better side by side. Also wondered if I could aggregate the data to show the average of the two graphs in one graph instead. She also encouraged me to think about changing the color scheme since the blues are being used with the intent to show "coldness" but are actually pleasing to the eye. She also thought that I might be able to change the language of the feelings somewhat.
- For Remedy #1 -- she encouraged me to think about how to portray the data in an infographic as opposed to a line graph. She gave the suggestion of two people shaking hands and two people with their backs to each other. Then, she said a figure (number/statistic) could be provided in a callout explaining what this means. She thought this may better convey the emotion of the story.
