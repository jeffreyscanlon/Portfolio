## User Research Protocol -- Interview Notes:

#### Interview with J.S. on 10/3/2020:
1.	What do you think is the overall purpose of this story?
It is showing the divide about the divide. People are experiencing political isolation. The first remedy is talking about experiences with people that are from a different group than you (so Democrat/Republican). The second graph is talking about the ability of perspective-taking that allows someone to tolerate/work with someone who is different from them. The third remedy is looking at the average bias (comparing the control and …) and how this one thing can help mitigate. Oh, these are remedies. Cool. That makes more sense. You are presenting issues and then these are the three solutions.

2.	Which visualization(s) or part of the story made the most sense or was the most convincing?
Easiest to understand: Our Aspirations vs. Our Reality and 8 out of 10 because very straight-forward.


3.	Which visualizations(s) or part of the story made the least sense or was the least convincing?
Hardest to understand: Remedy #2 Perspective-taking but mostly because I don't know what perspective-taking is. I get it's an intervention and I'm also guessing you will explain it so with explanation I think I would get it faster.

4.	Can you explain how the solutions presented in this story are connected to the problem?
Remedy 1 is talking about tolerance for individuals and positive intergroup contact…People from different backgrounds or different beliefs, there is poor contact with them. So intergroup contact increases contact. Perspective-taking allows for common ground and compromise and helps you feel less cold toward others. Democrat/Republic

5.	What other questions or recommendations do you have?
I think if you are trying to connect to people that don’t know statistics or science the terms (baseline or control might not make sense) or other terms like positive intergroup contact, but I don’t know how you would do that with graphics.

#### Interview with D.G. on 10/6/2020:

1.	What do you think is the overall purpose of this story?
To talk about the political divisions between the two parties, or the constituents that identify as democrat and republican. They don’t like each other very much and they don’t interact. The second half of the story talks about ways to potentially remedy those divisions (what steps could be taken and their impact).

2.	Which visualization(s) or part of the story made the most sense or was the most convincing?
Findings #1 and #2 were the easiest to understand and Finding #2 was new information to me so that was interesting. Finding #1 was the most compelling because it presents a stark contrast between our aspirations and our reality. This is because almost the same percentage of people agree about these two seemingly contrasting things.

3.	Which visualizations(s) or part of the story made the least sense or was the least convincing?
Remedy #2 was confusing because how is it showing that they are working across lines of difference. It only shows the number of tasks someone worked on. And Finding #3 was not convincing because it looks like people are feeling colder, but how much colder really? It doesn’t seem to be increasing that much.

4.	Can you explain how the solutions presented in this story are connected to the problem?
The solutions offer different strategies to alleviate the divisions between different groups and data that supports said strategy.

5.	What other questions or recommendations do you have?
What is the sample size of these data? How many people did they ask? Why is the reference line in Remedy #1? Why does the control group decrease after a certain amount of time in Remedy #3? The treatment group also starts to decline less rapidly there.


#### Interview with M.C. and A.B. on 10/6/2020:
[Went off script a little for this interview]

1. What do you think these first three visualizations are showing?

M.C.: I think these graphs are all connected to the political climate today. Within friends groups, you are likely to all have the same political views and support the same candidate. This is due to the increasing coldness since four years ago. Even though coldness is increasing, people still really want common ground and compromise. 

A.B.: Looking at our friend group – most of our friends work in education and education tends to be more liberal. And people working in business tend to be more conservative. So these graphs make me think about political diversity across employment groups and how those groups often determine who you are friends with. I think also polarization has become much more entrentched (since the Occupy Wall Street and Tea Party movement). So some parites that we in the past more moderate have been hijacked by more extreme groups.

2. What do you think these last three visualizations are showing?

M.C.: These are kind of building off the first graph where it talked about 83% agree about how polarization is worsening but 85% want people to work together. These graphs show three different ways that people can work together to achieve that goal (working together), how to make compromises and decrease polarization.

A.B.: These graphs show that friend groups can have rational disagreements (instead of devolving into name-calling) you can have civilized discussions about politics and how you can, kind of, understand the other people’s perspectives. 

3.	Which visualization(s) or part of the story made the most sense or was the most convincing?

M.C.: Finding 1 is really compelling, because it shows that even though the majority of population believes this one thing, the majority also wants this other, contrasting thing. Remedy #3 was very easy to understand.  Also the positive contact was good—but it intrigued me why the baseline was zero.

A.B.: I agree that Finding #1 was really interesting.

4.	Which visualizations(s) or part of the story made the least sense or was the least convincing?

M.C.: Title of Remedy #2 took me a couple of minutes to understand; I had to re-read it multiple times.

A.B.: Remedy #2 was most confusing.

5.	What other questions or recommendations do you have?

A.B.: What would be interesting is a statistic about percentage of couples that are politically split. I am more conservative than her but I'm not a Trump supporter. I also think it's good that you are ending on an optimistic note – even though there is all of this polarization, people can make it work and have rationalized discussions and debate without wanting to kill each other.

M.C.: The way they are arranged is really helpful and how they build off of each other is great. I also liked how Finding #1 starts because it starts the story off with something positive and not negative all the way. Like most people want common ground and that is a good thing.


#### Supplemental feedback -- I also met with the course TA on 10/6/2020 and she provided helpful feedback I'd like to record here:
- She thinks the changes made to Visualization for Finding #1 were a success -- said that in her opinion it was very clear to understand now.
- She provided some ideas for Finding #3 -- said that the graphs stacked vertically might do better side by side. Also wondered if I could aggregate the data to show the average of the two graphs in one graph instead. She also encouraged me to think about changing the color scheme since the blues are being used with the intent to show "coldness" but are actually pleasing to the eye. She also thought that I might be able to change the language of the feelings somewhat.
- For Remedy #1 -- she encouraged me to think about how to portray the data in an infographic as opposed to a line graph. She gave the suggestion of two people shaking hands and two people with their backs to each other. Then, she said a figure (number/statistic) could be provided in a callout explaining what this means. She thought this may better convey the emotion of the story.
