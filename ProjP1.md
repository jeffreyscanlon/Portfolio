# Final Project: Part 1
## Summary:

In the United States, there are many indicators pointing to one troubling reality: the country is becoming increasingly polarized. While polarization can have consequences that feel somewhat far-removed from our daily lives (for example, in congressional gridlock), I believe that people are feeling and experiencing the effects of this polarization on a daily basis in a very deep and personal way: from hateful and divisive rhetoric, to dehumanizing and “otherizing” the opposing party, to arguments with strangers over social media. My project, then, will address the following questions: <br>
 1.	Is there actually evidence to suggest that polarization is worsening in our country compared to other time periods?
 2.	Is there hope? What, if anything, can any of us do individually to overcome the negative effects of our ideological polarization? <br>
 
Spoiler Alert: Yes, there is always hope! In this project I will give you three researched strategies for overcoming the negative effects of polarization and provide you with specific ideas on how to implement these strategies.

## Outline:
### Possible Title:
**Common Ground: How you can bridge the divide in a time of heightened polarization**

### Hook:
The reader will participate in some form of reflection activity to get them thinking about their own feelings about politics and polarization in U.S. society today. This might be:
- a series of short reflection questions
- a thought experiment or mental visualization
- a short writing prompt: "Describe a time when..." <br>

*I will decide on which hook I want to use at a later time. However, this will not be included in my 2 minute presentation in order to save time.*

### Problem Statement:
A series of visualizations that illustrate that capture the scope and effects of polarization in the United States.

1. Visualization -- Our aspirations vs. our reality<br>
A large majority of survey respondents (85%) say that compromise and common ground should be the goal for political leaders.
However, the majority of respondents (83%) also said that political, racial, and class divisions are getting worse and our national dialogue is breaking down.

2. Visualization -- No, it's not just "them."<br>
There is a body of evidence that most of us live in ideological silos. We surround ourselves with those who we feel share the same ideologies.
Both 77% of Trump supporters and 77% of Biden supporters self-report that they have "just a few" or no friends who support the other candidate.

3. Visualization -- Why this matters: Polarization prejudices and dehumanizes<br>
Survey respondents are more likely to see members of opposing political parties as possessing negative qualities, including being:
- close-minded
- unintelligent
- immoral
- lazy
- unpatriotic<br>
They feel that, politics aside, the other party largely does not share their values and goals.<br>
There has been growth over the past four years in the percentage of respondents who feel "very cold" towards the opposing party.

4. Visualization -- Why this matters: Unrest and even...civil war?<br>
In October 2019, survey respondents gave an average rating of 67 on political polarization, on a range of 0 to 100, with 0 representing no polarization and 100 representing extreme polarization on the brink of civil war.
By August of 2020, this average rating increased 6 points to 73.

### What Have We Tried?
*I will not include this section in my presentation, but I made include it as supplemental information on my website.* <br>

Use the Prisoner's Dilemma to describe the situation that our two political parties often find themselves in. This dilemma states that both entities will be forced to utilize a strategy that ultimately yields smaller payoffs for both parties even though an alternative strategy exists under which both parties could yield larger payoffs. Why don't either of these parties use the alternative strategy? Because in order for it to work, both groups have to commit to using it. If one commits and the other pulls out, the one that has committed gets the short end of the stick. What is the alternative strategy to harsh rhetoric, vilifaction, and obstruction? Bipartisanship--reaching and working across the aisle. 

I may also make reference to the role of social media and how anonymity and digital- and text-based communications do not allow for the same degree of humanization, which contirubtes to much of the "nastiness" on these platforms.

### What can I do?
In this section, I will provide a series of visualizations that illustrate the effectiveness of social and behavioral strategies or interventions that each of us can practice in order to practice empathy and begin healing the strong ideological divides.

1. Strategy 1 -- Positive Intergroup Contact can reduce our prejudices and ease tensions.<br>
Define positive intergroup contact as experiences in which people get to interact and connect with people who are different from them and from most of their normal contacts. (This can mean ideologically different, or differnt in terms of race, gender, sexual orientation, class, religion, and more.)

2. Strategy 2 -- Social Perspective Taking helps us humanize others and makes us more likely to seek out intergroup contact.<br>
Define social perspective taking as the willingness and ability to infer and consider the perspectives of others who are unlike you.

3. Strategy 3 -- Reassociation Stereotype Replacement

## Data Sources

**Data Sources for Polarization**<br>
My data sources for polarization come from the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University and from the Pew Research Center. The data sets I will be using come from polls that each of these groups administer. Links to these data sources are found below.

I may also try to tie in data from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter or Facebook) or data about polarization in Congress (e.g. from the Congressional Research Service) if I feel that this would improve the story that I am telling. However, so far I have not found a relevant data set from any of these sources that add anything meaningful to this story, so I have thus far refrained from doing so.

**Data Sources for Solutions**<br>
My data sources for social or behavioral interventions or strategies that can be implemented to begin to heal the ideological divides come largely from publications made by social and behavioral science researchers in academic journals. These researchers have conducted controlled experiments and their findings indicate that these strategies have a positive impact on reducing social conflict and tension.
