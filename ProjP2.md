# Project: Part 2

### Storyboard

The storyboard below details the major components of my data story. However, I will likely add a few additional/supplmental data visualizations that are not depicted on this story board. Something that I might be able to learn from my User Research is which parts of the story might benefit from supplemental material because the story is confusing or uncompelling in certain places. During my Uer Research, I hope to identify which areas are leaving the strongest impression with my readers and which areas need to be improved. For those who have been following along, you may notice a few changes to some of the visualizations in this storyboard. For example, Findings #1 and #2 are probably the most noticeable changes from the rough outline I posted last week (see Project: Part 1). I redesigned these visualizations based on feedback I received from my peers during a small group activity in my Telling Stories with Data Class. I also made some changes to Finding #3 and Remedy #1, though these changes may be somewhat less obvious. With these improvements made, I am excited to get a new round of feedback from my interviewees!

### User Research Protocol
#### Goals and Questions

| Goals | Questions |
| --- | --- |
|Evaluate clarity of purpose |	How clear is the purpose of this story? Is it less clear to people who are less politically active? |
|Identify which visualizations are most confusing and/or not convincing | Which visualization made the most sense? Which one was most convincing? Which made the least sense? Which was least convincing? |
|Understand if audience is making connection between problem and solution | Can the audience explain 1) what the solutions are 2) how the solutions will help to solve the problem and 3) what the action steps are to implement the solutions. |

#### Target Audience
My target audience is the general population of the United States (lay-people). Importantly, this means I am not gearing my stories towards any one profession or industry, so I want to make sure I remove jargon or other forms of technical language from my story that could alienate viewers. Though this is intended for the general population, I would ideally like to target people who identify to some extent as part of one of the two major political parties. Evidence indicates that people who identify more closely or strongly with a political party are more likely to hold biases against the other party. So, while this story should be geared toward anyone with any degree of political affiliation, I would like for it to be most compelling to those who are most politically active or identify as strongly aligned to one party.

#### Representative Individuals to Interview:
The three people that I am interviewing represent a range of professions (none of which are actively political in nature). Two of them have careers in education and the other works in healthcare. While I would like to make the demographics as diverse as possible, this is challenging with a sample size of three. 2 of the respondents are White women, 1 is a Black man. 2 of the respondents identify as straight/heterosexual, and the other identifies as queer. Unfortunately, I myself fall within the 77% of candidate supporters who have “just a few” or no friends who support the other candidate. Thus, all three of the people in this interview have the same political alignment as myself. Lastly, these three individuals hold somewhat positions on the conservative-liberal spectrum (some tend to align further in one direction than the others), based on my extensive conversations with them in the past.

*Note - I actually ended up interviewing one additional person during one of the interview. This individual is a male, white, who works in financial services. He identifies as more conservative than most of the friends in his friend group.

#### Interview Script:
Hello, thanks for taking the time to hop on a call with me.

My goal today is to get feedback on a data story I have developed. I’m interviewing people to ask what makes sense and what is confusing about the story and the visualizations. So, I'm actually going to give you a minute or two to look over the visualizations and I'm not going to tell you anything about them, because I'm trying to figure out how good of a job the visualizations are doing at speaking for themselves. [Take a minute pause.]

1.	What do you think is the overall purpose of this story?

2.	Which visualization(s) or part of the story made the most sense or was the most convincing?

3.	Which visualizations(s) or part of the story made the least sense or was the least convincing?

4.	Can you explain how the solutions presented in this story are connected to the problem?

5.	What other questions or recommendations do you have?


### Findings
For the sake of reducing screen clutter, I will simply provide a summary of the main findings from my interviews in this section.\

**To read the full transcripts (notes) from my interviews, you may [click here.](InterviewNotes.md)**

Here are some common trends that came out of the interview:
- I was pleasantly surprised to see that all of the individuals interviewed felt that Finding #1 was easy to understand, and many pointed to it as the most compelling figure. I was happy to hear this because I spent a good amount of time redesigning this visualization after getting feedback in class.
- I was not suprised that the three visualization about the three remedies were the most confusing and least compelling. However, I was surprised that all of my interviewees were most confused by Remedy #2 (about perspective-taking) than the other two remedies. The feedback on this visualization indicates that the meaning of this visualization is being lost, and that the title is not helping.
- People were able to explain the purpose of the visualizations and the overall purpose of this data story, but they in general had a little more difficulty articulating what the remedy findings were showing. However, they were all able to identify that they these remedies were actions, in some shape or form, that are supposed to heal some of the divides that were discussed in the findings section. People were also seeking more information, context, or validation from the remedies than they are currently providing. In other words, they seemed to be sparking more questions than they are producing meaning or value.
- 3 of the 4 interviewees commented on (in some way or another) some of the scientific and/or statistical jargon in the Remedy visualizations. For example, some mentioned the terms "Control", and how they thought that would be confusing to some readers, while others said the same for the term "Baseline" or the presence of the line representing the baseline. These comments confirmed my suspicions that the scientific and statistical jargon needs to be removed and that the visualizations themselves need to be redesigned entirely away from this premise.
- Each of the interviewers reflected different levels of emotions being elicited by this story. Without prompting (with the exception of asking for which visualizations were convicing or compelling), one individual reflected on how the story elicited strong positive emotions, while two reflected moderate emotions, and a fourth didn't seem to indicate an emotional response to the visualizaitons at all.
- I also didn't explicitly ask any of the participants to what extent they see themselves (their own identities, life stories, or friend groups) reflected in this story, and participants gave cues to suggest they were applying this information to their own lives to different degrees. For example, A.B. seemed to reflect on this openly the most. He discussed how he and his girlfriend have slightly different political leanings and how he also doesn't always share the same political beliefs with many in his friend group. Other interviewees only hinted at this internalization by using words like "we" to refer to these problems and solutions being something experienced by others and by ourselves. I find it striking that A.B. showed the most immediacy in internalizing the message in this way and the fact that he often sees himself as an outsider in his friend group. This makes me wonder if the story may be easier to internalize for those who are already make considerable efforts on a regular basis to forge relationships across lines of difference (political or otherwise).

### Changes to Implement
Based on the feedback from this interview, I plan to make the following changes:
1. Redesign the entire premise of the remedies. Rather than using a bar graph or line graph chart style, I think more of an infographic style would be more effective. The infographics could show examples (clip art, icons, etc) of what the interventions (positive intergroup contact, perspective-taking, and stereotype replacement) look like (for example, two people facing each other and shaking hands, and two people with their backs turned toward each other), with callout boxes indicating a simple number or statistic as to the outcome of those interventions (and perhaps a second callout explaining the mechanism of the intervention itself.) I think by rendering the infographic as almost a recreation or simulation for what the behavioral intervention entails, this might also draw out the emotional aspect of each remedy by showing people interacting with each other in positive or negative ways.
2. I will likely aggregate the data in Finding #3 in order to produce only one (averaged) 100% stacked area chart as opposed to having two charts. However, I am also considering finding a new way to represent this data because I noticed some of my interviewees struggled to read the chart in the correct way.
3. Some of the individuals were seeking additional information that was not provided anywhere in the individual visualizations. Some were seeking more information about the data used for each visualization, while others were seeking additional information or statistics related to certain findings. For example, one interviewee wanted to know the sample size for some of the visualizations. This is something that I myself would like to see on visualizations, but that I intentionally left off of the visualizations because I felt it could be distracting or confusing to more readers than it is helpful. Therefore, I'd like to reach out to professor Goranson and also our class TA to ask how they might recommend incoporating something like this. I also plan to develop a few supplemental visualizations that may not be used in my 2 minute presentation but can be provided on my Shorthand page and that people can view on their own time in order to gain a wider or deeper understanding of some of these issues.
