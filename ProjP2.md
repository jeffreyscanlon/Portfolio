# Project: Part 2

### Storyboard

The storyboard below details the major components of my data story. However, I will likely add a few additional/supplmental data visualizations that are not depicted on this story board. Something that I might be able to learn from my User Research is which parts of the story might benefit from supplemental material because the story is confusing or uncompelling in certain places. During my Uer Research, I hope to identify which areas are leaving the strongest impression with my readers and which areas need to be improved. For those who have been following along, you may notice a few changes to some of the visualizations in this storyboard. For example, Findings #1 and #2 are probably the most noticeable changes from the rough outline I posted last week (see Project: Part 1). I redesigned these visualizations based on feedback I received from my peers during a small group activity in my Telling Stories with Data Class. I also made some changes to Finding #3 and Remedy #1, though these changes may be somewhat less obvious. With these improvements made, I am excited to get a new round of feedback from my interviewees!

### User Research Protocol
#### Goals and Questions
| Goals | Questions |
| --- | --- |
|Evaluate clarity of purpose |	How clear is the purpose of this story? Is it less clear to people who are less politically active? |
|Identify which visualizations are most confusing and/or not convincing | Which visualization made the most sense? Which one was most convincing? Which made the least sense? Which was least convincing? |
|Understand if audience is making connection between problem and solution | Can the audience explain 1) what the solutions are 2) how the solutions will help to solve the problem and 3) what the action steps are to implement the solutions. |

#### Audience Analysis
<div class="bg-gray-light mb-2">
*Target Audience:* My target audience is the general population of the United States (lay-people). Importantly, this means I am not gearing my stories towards any one profession or industry, so I want to make sure I remove jargon or other forms of technical language from my story that could alienate viewers. Though this is intended for the general population, I would ideally like to target people who identify to some extent as part of one of the two major political parties. Evidence indicates that people who identify more closely or strongly with a political party are more likely to hold biases against the other party. So, while this story should be geared toward anyone with any degree of political affiliation, I would like for it to be most compelling to those who are most politically active or identify as strongly aligned to one party.

*Representative Individuals to Interview:* The three people that I am interviewing represent a range of professions (none of which are actively political in nature). Two of them have careers in education and the other works in healthcare. While I would like to make the demographics as diverse as possible, this is challenging with a sample size of three. 2 of the respondents are White women, 1 is a Black man. 2 of the respondents identify as straight/heterosexual, and the other identifies as queer. Unfortunately, I myself fall within the 77% of candidate supporters who have “just a few” or no friends who support the other candidate. Thus, all three of the people in this interview have the same political alignment as myself. Lastly, these three individuals hold somewhat positions on the conservative-liberal spectrum (some tend to align further in one direction than the others), based on my extensive conversations with them in the past.

*Interview Script:*

Hello, thanks for taking the time to hop on a call with me.

My goal today is to get feedback on a data story I have developed. I’m interviewing people to ask what makes sense and what is confusing about the story and the visualizations. So, I'm actually going to give you a minute or two to look over the visualizations and I'm not going to tell you anything about them, because I'm trying to figure out how good of a job the visualizations are doing at speaking for themselves. [Take a minute pause.]

1.	What do you think is the overall purpose of this story?

2.	Which visualization(s) or part of the story made the most sense or was the most convincing?

3.	Which visualizations(s) or part of the story made the least sense or was the least convincing?

4.	Can you explain how the solutions presented in this story are connected to the problem?

5.	What other questions or recommendations do you have?|
